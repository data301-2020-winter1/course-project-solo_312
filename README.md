## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I was raised in Hong Kong and I have lived there for 18 years. I would like to investigate the different Airbnb places in Hong Kong as I often have friends coming over to visit and I thought that it would be great if I could have some knowledge about different Airbnb places in Hong Kong and provide them with some information when they come over to visit. I would like to analyze the dataset and compare indicators such as reviews, price, cleaning fee, whether the host is a superhost, host experience, host response rate, host acceptance rate etc. Personally, I have a superhost certificate and I know a thing or two about hospitality and customer service. I worked as a customer representative in Hoi Tin Athletes' Association for 4 months and temporary salesperson of Saint Honore's Bakery for 1 month. I interacted with many customers on a daily basis and know how it is like to provide customer service for them. I hope to apply some of my knowledge in this project area.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset contains 11187 rows of data for many different Airbnb options in Hong Kong. There are many fields for String types such as house rules, transit, name, summary, location, space, access, interactions, host about etc. These are difficult to compare with one another due to the wide variety of different responses for each String type. However, there are some Strings which are easier to compare, such as property type, room type, amenities, location, cancellation policy, whether the host is superhost etc. These have more fixed number of responses and it is easier to measure these fields on a scale and compare them to decide which option is the best. Lastly, there are number fields for reviews, price, cleaning fee, host acceptance rate, host response rate, reviews per month etc. I can also use these number fields to compare the different options with one another and decide which option is the best.
