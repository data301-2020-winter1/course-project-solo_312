Introduction to Processed Dataset

The processed dataset contains *11187 rows of data* for **many different Airbnb options in Hong Kong**. I have processed it to leave only the numerical fields as well as several String fields which I consider to be ordinal data. I will be adding more information into this ReadMe file once I have finalised the processed dataset.
